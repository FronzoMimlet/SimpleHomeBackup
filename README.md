# Hello

Note: Before you tell me that there is some other thing that already exists that does this like 20x better, I know, I did this for fun and to get more acquainted with bash scripting.

This is not fully featured, this is a script I made to save me manually doing this very simple process.

I have plans to further expand this into something that could be considered 'not awful' a code overhaul, new features etc. I might even turn it into a C app so I can get some C practice in. In the mean time, I'm busy with uni so I'm not really able to commit too much time to it.

And yes, I do use this script every time I back up, I don't know how this would attribute any greater value to it, but it does the job I wanted it to do at least.

Any tips on improving my awful bash are appreciated. Thanks <3
